    Welcome to My Favorite Running Items — a space all about the gear that keeps me moving! Here, I share my go-to shoes, accessories, and tech that make every run feel better, faster, and more fun. Whether you’re just getting started or you’ve logged countless miles, you’ll find honest reviews, personal favorites, and tips to help you get the most out of your runs.

   In high school, I ran cross country and fell in love with the challenge of long-distance racing. It taught me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance—lessons that stick with me far beyond the finish line. Running has always been more than just a sport for me; it’s a journey of self-discovery and growth. Every mile reminds me of where I started and how much I’ve accomplished. It continues to push me to set new goals, explore new trails, and share my passion for running with others.
