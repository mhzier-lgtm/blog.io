    Hey! I’m Maya, and running has always been a huge part of my life. I’ve loved it for as long as I can remember—ever since I first laced up a pair of running shoes as a kid and just took off. I ran my first race when I was 8 and finished my first half marathon at 13, which taught me what it really means to push my limits. Running has shown me how rewarding it feels to work hard toward a goal and has become something I can’t imagine my life without.
